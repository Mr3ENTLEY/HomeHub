## Who Could Benefit from Home Hub

While Home Hub is not targeted at a specific audience. It could be especially useful for users and managers of Airbnb units who want to self-host a centralized dashboard for managing their units. Additionally, it's an excellent starting point for anyone looking to explore self-hosting.
